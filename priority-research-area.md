## Objectives

The main objectives of the priority research area **Evolutionary Systems
Biology** at the University of Potsdam are threefold:

 1. to promote internationally competitive research in Evolutionary Systems
 Biology at the Institute of Biochemistry and Biology, University of Potsdam 
 2. to attract and train highly promising junior researchers and group leaders
	in this emerging field,
 3. to establish the University of Potsdam as a leading institution in 
	Evolutionary Systems Biology.
	
## Goals

To understand how biodiversity came about through evolution, it is necessary
to explain how the underlying molecular and cellular networks have changed to
produce the diversity of living organisms. Such an understanding will facilitate
systematic improvements to crop plants and livestock that were not possible before.

The overarching goal of **evolutionary systems biology** is to bring concepts and
techniques of systems biology to bear on evolutionary questions and at the
same time to propel further developments in systems biology by appropriating
quantitative approaches from evolutionary genetics.

## Aims
The specific aims of the priority research area **Evolutionary Systems Biology**
 at the University of Potsdam are twofold:
 
  1. to study the extent to which phenotypic differences between organisms 
    have arisen due to natural selection at the level of quantitative changes 
    to the underlying molecular networks, and

  2. to understand whether an emerging property of robustness, plasticity,
    and trade-offs of and between traits can be realized by different network
    architectures in independently evolved organisms.
